Comprehensive code review of the website with report and prioritized backlog

**Outcome**: A thorough code review identifies quality issues, performance bottlenecks, accessibility gaps, security concerns, and maintainability problems across the website codebase. The review produces a structured report with findings and a prioritized backlog of improvements, so the team has a clear roadmap for incremental quality improvements.

**Success criteria**:
- Report covers all major review dimensions: code quality, performance, accessibility, security, SEO, and maintainability
- Each finding includes severity (critical/high/medium/low), description, and recommended fix
- Backlog items are prioritized and actionable (each can be picked up as an independent task)
- Report is written to a file in the repo for future reference

**Scope**:
- In: All website source code (HTML, CSS, JS, templates, configuration, build setup), content structure, asset optimization, deployment config
- Out: Content accuracy/copywriting, business logic decisions, third-party service configurations outside the repo
